<hr>
<p>We left last class: semaphores and CV. Different primitives for concurrency problem.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Semaphore:<ul class="list">
<li>any number of resources. <code>P</code> acquire, <code>V</code> release. Use as a lock. Keep in mind it&#39;s not lock. There&#39;s no built-in protection for it, no track of ownership: someone else tries to release <strong>binary</strong> semaphore on me, they can, and we have race condition.</li>
<li><strong>counting</strong>: keep counting # of resources</li>
<li><strong>barrier</strong>: force one thread to wait for others to complete before we proceed. Not separate implementation.</li>
<li>keep in mind do not touch the counter directly. It&#39;s a shared resource.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CV: you are inside critical section. You really need condition to be true to proceed. But the lock you own it the lock you are using to protect the shared variable that has unique value. CV lets us do simultaneously safely let go of the lock and fall asleep so that another thread can modify the condition and wake us back up.<br>
Most of the type we are using: when we are woken back up, we need to recheck the condition.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-sources-of-race-conditions"><a class="header-link" href="#other-sources-of-race-conditions"></a>Other sources of Race conditions</h2>
<p>The previous RC is because of the code you wrote.</p>
<p><strong>memory models</strong> describe how thread access to memory in shared regions behave. a memory model tells the compiler and CPU which optimizations can be performed</p>
<p><strong>compiler</strong>: it does optimization. Reduce the # of assembly instrs: load and stores.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> sharedTotal = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">FuncA</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

    <span class="hljs-comment">//... code that uses sharedTotal ...</span>
}</code></pre><p>Instead of go to RAM, much more efficient to keep it in register: register allocation. Here&#39;s the problem: It doesn&#39;t know if A and B run at the same time. If one put in <code>$3</code> one in <code>$8</code>. Big race condtion. There are also others optimization.</p>
<p>Always load/store var from RAM, not reordering: <code>volatile</code>. Disable compiler optimizations, but not solve race conditions in your codes.</p>
<p><strong>CPU</strong>: fetch the program counter, decode it, execute it and move on. But it&#39;s more complex: pipeline, branch prediction, reorder instrs... It also has memory model and so that you can notify the CPU: multi-threaded code is going on here. Barrier or fence instrs to entry gate: CPU stops rearranging. And until end gate, turn on opt back on. Don&#39;t need to worry in OS161.</p>

<p>Re-implement <code>func1</code> and <code>func2</code> using lock and cv.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: func1 is consumer, func2 is producer.</p>

}</code></pre><h1 id="process"><a class="header-link" href="#process"></a>Process</h1>
<p>is an is an environment in which an application program runs.</p>
<p>includes virtualized resources that its program can use: one (or more) threads</p>
<p>each program’s process <em>isolates</em> it from other programs in other processes</p>
<h2 id="fork"><a class="header-link" href="#fork"></a>fork</h2>
<p>creates a brand new process (the child) that is a clone of the original (the parent)</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>new process structure</li>
<li>new address space</li>
<li>new thread array</li>
<li>new PID
clone</li>
<li>content of address space</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_exit"><a class="header-link" href="#_exit"></a>_exit</h2>
<p>terminate the calling process. Not necessarily disappear: stop executing, address space get cleaned, but if it has parents, that parent is alive. Parents want to figure out why child dies. Leave behind a msg for parent.</p>
<h2 id="waitpid"><a class="header-link" href="#waitpid"></a>waitpid</h2>
<p>offer synchronization between processes. Cause the caller to wait for the PID process to terminate. Restricted to: parent can only wait for their children to die.</p>
<p>Children cannot wait for their parents. If they die, they are old.</p>
<h2 id="execv"><a class="header-link" href="#execv"></a>execv</h2>
<p>Now, the last of the five system calls: execv. It does not create a new process.</p>
<p>It changes the program and a existing process is running. Process structure is same, but the address space has changed.</p>
<p><code>Hello world</code> program, and call <code>execv matlab</code>.</p>
<p>Create a new address space, and load the program into the new address space.</p>
<p>Parent child relationship: If you go home tonight, and dye your hair in green, your parent may not like it. But they cannot change genetically they are your parents. The same is true for processes: you can change the program that you are running but you cannot change parent-child relationship.</p>
<p>Example from slides:</p>

    <span class="hljs-built_in">exit</span>(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
}</code></pre><p>takes two parameters. Many times you need command line arguments. Array of pointers.</p>
<p><code>execv</code> if it succeeds, does not return. Because it successfully created the new address space and new program. We successfully loaded the program into it. The calling program will not exist if <code>execv</code> succeeded. The only time it returns is when it fails. Why would it fail? 30mb ram then run Matlab. It&#39;s possible that there&#39;s no memory left or you call the program wrongly. When you write your <code>execv</code>, you need to test for these error cases and return appropriate error codes. (but cs350 stuff don&#39;t have such tests on these).</p>
<p>You notice that we can&#39;t tell how many arguments there are automatically. So we use null terminator array and you are responsible for counting.</p>
<p>Another example. This time with fork.</p>

}</code></pre><p>Now I have two processes. Even though they are separate, but their contents are identical with the exception of value of <code>rc</code>. 0 for child, pid for parent.</p>
<p>If child, <code>execv</code>. Child is running different process. Parent can still wait for child to terminate. Parent child relationship is not impacted by <code>execv</code> which stays forever.</p>
<p>Go home and write thread fork bomb.</p>
<h1 id="system-calls"><a class="header-link" href="#system-calls"></a>System Calls</h1>
<ul class="list">

<p><strong>Key Question</strong>: Since application programs cannot directly call the

<p><strong>Key Question</strong>: There is only one <code>syscall</code> exception, <code>EX_SYS</code>. So how does the OS distinguish between a <code>fork</code> and <code>getpid</code> system call?</p>

<h2 id="user-and-kernel-stacks"><a class="header-link" href="#user-and-kernel-stacks"></a>User and Kernel Stacks</h2>
<p>Every OS/161 process thread has two stacks, although it only uses one at a time.</p>
<ol class="list">
<li>The User (Application) Stack is used while the thread is executing application code.<ul class="list">
<li>Saw this in <a href="/19-05/CS241/">CS 241</a>.</li>
<li>The kernel creates this stack when it sets up the virtual address space for the process (or thread if the OS supports multi-threaded code).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Kernel Stack is used while the thread is executing kernel code, i.e. after an exception or interrupt.<ul class="list">
<li>This stack is a kernel structure (i.e. it is located in the kernel’s address space).</li>
<li>It also holds trap frames and switch frames (because it is the kernel that creates trap frames and switch frames)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="exception-handling"><a class="header-link" href="#exception-handling"></a>Exception Handling</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>first to run assembly code, <code>common_exception</code><ul class="list">
<li>save stack pointer</li>
<li>switches SP to point to the thread&#39;s kernel stack,</li>
<li>carefully saves app state and address of the instruction,</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>After <code>mips_trap</code> is finished, the <code>common_exception</code> handler will<ul class="list">

<h3 id="mips_trap"><a class="header-link" href="#mips_trap"></a>mips_trap</h3>
<p>determines what type of exception it is by looking at the exception code.</p>
<p>there is a separate handler in the kernel for each type of exception.</p>
<p>Kernel is just a program, a sequence of instructions.</p>
<p>Two type of calls:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>procedure calls: used by apps to execute other application code,</li>
<li>sys calls: exec kernel code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multiprocessing"><a class="header-link" href="#multiprocessing"></a>Multiprocessing</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>The OS ensures that <em>processes are isolated from one another</em>.</li>
<li>Interprocess communication should be possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind, it&#39;s not processes that run. Threads execute. Process has to have a thread in order to execute, so we really are talking about multithreads. Now we have a pool of threads, which belong to different processes. Only when quantum expires, we do context switch. (Timer interrupt)</p>
<h2 id="stack-diagrams"><a class="header-link" href="#stack-diagrams"></a>Stack Diagrams</h2>
<p>In the next few minutes, I&#39;m gonna show you stack diagrams because you&#39;d better bet they are going to show up on your exams.</p>
<p><code>mips_trap</code>&#39;s job is to figure out what kind of exception that actually raised. Then call the handler that is specific to this exception. Now we are going to execute <code>mips_trap</code>. Now after we check that if it&#39;s an interrupt or not, then it realizes that it is not an interrupt, then <code>mips_trap</code> will turn exceptions and interrupts back on. It means that while we are executing our sys call, we CAN be interrupted. KEEP THAT IN MIND.</p>
<p>Look at <code>v0</code> and that&#39;s going to tell you which syscal we actually want to run (a great big old <code>switch</code> statement). We want <code>sys_fork</code>. Now interrupts are on which means you can be preempted while executed this fork.</p>
<p>So now what happens to our stack: If we have a timer interrupt. First thing you see is trap frame (produced by <code>common_exception</code>). Push a trapframe onto the kernel stack. Since we are already in privilege mode and on kernel stack, you actually know the <code>common_exception</code> code. If we are on kernel stack, we don&#39;t do anything but just save the trapframe right. Then call <code>mips_trap</code> to figure out what just happened. It&#39;s <code>mainbus_interrupt</code>. It&#39;s hardware interrupt. While they are handling interrupts from hardware, we don&#39;t want to handle other hardware interrupts because this is the behaviour that is outside the control that thread is running and we don&#39;t to disrupt it for too long so generally leave it off.</p>
<p>In <code>mainbus_interrupt</code>, we discover it&#39;s the clock. Call interrupt handler for the clock: exceed schedule quantum, I&#39;d better preempt you. So call <code>thread_yield</code> -&gt; <code>thread_switch</code> -&gt; <code>switch_frame</code>. Context switch occurs. Popping off the stack, then returns to ... Then go back to <code>common_exception</code> where we restore the trapframe. Btw, we are turning the interrupts back on. Then back to user stack, reset the CPU back to unprivileged mode and now we go back to have a process to thread running its regular user mode. Similar to multithreads, but we have two stacks.</p>
<p>Now suppose we don&#39;t have interrupt. Return to syscall. At the very end of syscall, set return value and success/failure values for that system. Zero: success; One: failure. The last thing in syscall dispatcher（调度）, <strong>increment program counter</strong> because when the exception is raised we didn&#39;t actually increment it.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (err) { <span class="hljs-comment">/* err */</span>

}

<span class="hljs-comment">/* advance PC */</span>
tf-&gt;tf_epc += <span class="hljs-number">4</span>;</code></pre><p><code>mips_trap</code> returns to <code>common_exception</code>. The trapframe data is
restored. Switch from kernel to user stack. Switch to unprivileged
mode (<code>rfe</code>: magical instruction). User code continues execution.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>These diagrams are always on either midterm or final.</li>
<li>It is not possible for you to have two track frames back-to-back in OS/161. Reason for that is because when the exception is raised at the CPU, interrupts are turned off and they do not come back on again until at least halfway through <code>mips_trap</code> which means that each trapframe must be separated by at least <code>mips_trap</code>.</li>
</ul>
