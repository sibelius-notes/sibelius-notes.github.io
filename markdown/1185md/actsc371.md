# Chapter 4: Risk and Return
Different investments carry different levels of risk and different levels of return. A
30 day treasury bill issued by the Government of Canada is not as risky as a ten year bond issued
by Canadian Tire say. If the two investments paid the same return to investors,
no one would buy the Canadian Tire bond. Investors must be
compensated for the risk, or they won't invest. We saw from the historical survey on
investment returns, that generally, investors are compensated for risk. Equity investors have
earned higher rates of return over the long term than debt investors have, etc.

# Chapter 5: Capital Allocation to Risky Assets
## Risk and Risk Aversion
The utility value of any investment or investment portfolio refers to the attractiveness
of that investment’s risk/return profile.

# Chapter 7: Captital Asset Pricing Model
Modern portfolio theory is a mathematical framework for building a portfolio of risky assets in order to optimize the expected return for a given level of risk. It reveals that since it is the return and risk of the portfolio
that is of utmost importance, securities should be managed by their contibution to increasing the return and reducing the risk of the portfolio, rather than based on the risk and return levels for each individual security.
