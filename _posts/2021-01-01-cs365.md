[Prof's notes](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~eblais/cs365/) is quite incomplete,
by which I mean he deliberately left out the proof and let the students fill in
as a part of the weekly report (40% of this course).

Some of the proofs of the results in this course can be found in [cs 360](/cs360). This course covers   space complexity which cs 360 doesn't.
