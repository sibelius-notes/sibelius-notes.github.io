I have different version of notes available here...
- [scattered notes](/markdown/1201/cs341/),
- [midterm review](/markdown/1201/cs341mid/),
- [post-mid notes](/mdf/1201/cs341). This one has much better quality than previous two, where I have combined
different offerings to make sure I got everything clear.

This midterm was brutal... avg was about 65... and last term was about 78, and added 3 marks for everyone...

The material (reduction, algorithms, complexity theory) is pretty standard and straightforward if you have a good prof like in Fall 2019.
