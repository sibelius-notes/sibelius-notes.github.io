This midterm was brutal... avg was about 65... and last term was about 78, and added 3 marks for everyone...

The material (reduction, algorithms, complexity theory) is pretty standard and straightforward if you have a good prof like in Fall 2019.

Note that the notes will be remade for this course near future due to the renovation of the website during early 2021.
