This course is pretty much like Lushman's [cs 246e](/cs246e) style: lots of things, hard, time-consuming, but learn a lot definitely. (I am creating a circular argument)

This course covers all [cs 136](/cs136) contents in about half of the course. Then the rest discusses more Racket, some [cs 245](/cs245) stuff (program verification), baby compiler and so on. The compiler stuff is almost the same as the beginning and end of [cs 241](/cs241). So Brad recommends taking [cs 241e](/cs241e) instead of cs 241.

The course frequently switches gears, i.e., jump from topics to topics, so doing the assignments will help you keep up with the lecture material.
