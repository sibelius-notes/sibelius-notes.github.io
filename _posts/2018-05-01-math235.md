Taught by [Robert Garbary](https://uwaterloo.ca/math/about/people/rgarbary). Also hold an online session at the same time, and hold a Skype office hours for them...

His notes was summarized, so no need to copy tons of examples.

He also made a joke with his mic. He went outside to drink some water. When he was still outside the classroom, he said, with his mic on:"I know you can hear me."

# Remarks
235 is more well-structured than 136... If you screwed up with 136, 235 is still ok.

# Notes
I started to learn LaTeX from this term... So here is a set of [compact notes](/pdf/1185/math235/math235.pdf).
