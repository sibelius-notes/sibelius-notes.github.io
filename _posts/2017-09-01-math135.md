During the first lecture, the [last example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem_on_friends_and_strangers) is extremely hard to understand. Fortunately, it won't be tested.

Then it will introduce some basic concepts like:

>
Statement: a sentence that is True or False.
Proposition: claim that requires a proof.
Theorem: Strong proposition.
Lemma: Weak proposition.
Corollary: Follows immediately from a proposition.
Axiom: A given truth.

Then the course covers number theory and so on. Let's take a look at what math 145 ([snew](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snew/)) does:
- Logic and Proof (with many axioms introduced)
- Rings, Fields, Orders and Induction (pmath 347/348)
- Complex Numbers (pmath 352?)
- Cardinality
- Factorization of Integers
- Congruence and Modular Arithmetic
- Cryptography (co 487)
- Factorization in Rings (pmath 348)
- Various Topics in Number Theory

So this is pretty much a super set of math 135 in all aspects.

I don't have much well-typed notes. Course notes together with lectures shoud be enough.
