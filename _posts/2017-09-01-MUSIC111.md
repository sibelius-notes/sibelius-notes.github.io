    <h2 style="color:white;"> Music rudiments </h2>
---

Over the years, this course is taught by [Trevor Wagler](https://www.trevorwagler.com/): French horn player and orchestrator. He is passionate about what he is teaching.

To be honest, this course is extremely easy if you have **a** little background. So "this course is **not** intended for students with *more than* a minimal music background" from the official description.

Also note that it does not fulfil Music major or minor requirements though it can boost your average. If you have strong musical background, take [music 270](/music/270) instead. 270 starts with a little bit rudiments and then jumps to the harmony part.

The notes above is based on the version of Fall 2020, taught by [Karen Sunabacka](https://uwaterloo.ca/grebel/people-profiles/karen-sunabacka). This offering covers a bit more about tonality.
