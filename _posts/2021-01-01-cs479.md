This course is advertised as theoretical neuroscience, and use [*Theoretical Neuroscience*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/theoretical-neuroscience) as textbook. However, only chapter 1 of this textbook is covered as theoretical material, the rest like information theory was not covered... This course is more like a standard survey of networks in machine learning, all types of networks.

Note that in CNN part (section 7,3), I didn't complete the rest of notes because he was reading off the cs231n slides, stanford course. To obtain a full understanding, you can read their [lecture notes](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/).
