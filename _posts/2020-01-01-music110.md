[Test 1 review notes](/pdf/1201/mus110_unit1.pdf). Held on Feb 13th, 2020.

[Test 2 review notes](/pdf/1201/mus110_test2_review.pdf). Held between Apr 2nd and Apr 9th.

This is a good course on an introduction to cultural contexts... I think this course is more on musicology: study different music cultural things, like different parts of the world.

To get good grades, ensure that you need to participate in the class by writing decent journals. Proofread anything you write, especially on **grammars** and the examples you are referring to.

Taught by [Dr. Sum](https://uwaterloo.ca/grebel/people-profiles/maisie-sum) and [Dr. Steiner](https://uwaterloo.ca/grebel/people-profiles/kate-kennedy-steiner). Be aware that Dr. Sum doesn't post any lecture slides online and Dr. Steiner posts them. Thus take notes.
