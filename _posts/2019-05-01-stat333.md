 > I was auditing this course during this term.

This term was taught by [Pengfei Li](http://sas.uwaterloo.ca/~p4li/), who was acknowledged to make this course as the easiest offering among all. I audited for about half a term, but after the random walk section, I felt that I couldn't follow the ideas without doing any assignments.

To be honest, tests and assignments were easy, but the final was hard. Therefore, professor curved the final grade then avg was about 75.32%, while 14 students got 100.

The partial lecture notes can be found [here](/markdown/1195/stat333/) or [typora converter version](/markdown/1195/stat333_/). There is also a scanned handwritten lecture note by professor, which is available upon request (if not violating UW policies).
