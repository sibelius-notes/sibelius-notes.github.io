This course is pretty much like Lushman's [cs 146](/cs146) style: lots of things, hard, time-consuming, but learn a lot definitely. If you enjoy cs146, definitely consider taking cs246e.

The course is well-structed. It proposes several problems, and solves them to introduce new concepts.

About 50% more contents than [cs 246](/cs246)... and the final project is VIM (if they didn't change it).

Start the assignments early and go to office hours.
