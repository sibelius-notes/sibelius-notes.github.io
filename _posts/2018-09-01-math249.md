He repeated the recurrence example for four times... spent so much time on calculation, didn't enrich a lot. He did introduced some new topics in enumeration like tilings, but nothing in graph theory, or even less than math 239... This is more structured with [Kevin](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~kpurbhoo/), but much more difficult with assignments and tests, but you have the curve at the end.


The following courses are [CO 342](/co/342)/[442](/co/442), CO 330/430.
