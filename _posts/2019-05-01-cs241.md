The course is to introduce a basic compiler idea. Start from very beginning to final MIPS code which can be understood by your machine.

Assignments are code heavy, while tests are theory heavy... and not that useful if you don't go to theoretical computer science (cs 360/365, cs 442, cs 462 which are great but...).

Be prepared for isolated assignments and tests... They are completely different. Understand every concepts from lecture or tutorial if possible.
