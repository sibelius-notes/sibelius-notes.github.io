Please refer to [music 116](/music116) for ensemble description.

I will explain why the photo is [missing](https://uwaterloo.ca/music/about/people/g4yun). This was the last term he directed the UW choir. He has been conducting for 10 years. After that, he accepted his position as a full-time professor in [WLU](https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-music/faculty-profiles/gerard-yun/index.html).

He reused the piece long time ago: The Gloria by Francis Poulenc, pretty recent one. This music is great in any aspects...

Final thing: It is always amazing to be *in* the Choir to feel the music.
