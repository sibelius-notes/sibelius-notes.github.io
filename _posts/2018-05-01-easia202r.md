This course is taught by a single instructor all over the terms. Some said it's easy to get 98... I am not sure why she gave me such a low mark...

Anyway, just prepare the slides and textbooks before the final...

Here is my [presentation](/pdf/1185/easia202r/slides.pdf).

Also, we were required to submit a [book review](/pdf/1185/easia202r/China_in_ten_words.pdf). I chose *China in Ten Words* by Yu Hua. Here is the [reflection](/pdf/1185/easia202r/after_thoughts.pdf).
