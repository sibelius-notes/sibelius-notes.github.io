At the beginning, I was expecting that auditing this course would help me on [cs 241](/19-05/CS241/) next term. Similarly with [cs 145](../CS145/), I can't learn anything without doing the assignments...

The course's structure is changing all over the years since it was invented, but the main idea is the same.

The most pleasing thing is all tests on marmoset is public... but takes some time to pass them all...

This is more abstract than cs 241, but it's not that hard if you get all assignments.

Here are [fall 2016 notes](http://davepagurek.github.io/SE-Notes/cs241e/CS241e.html) from Dave Pagurek. Note that you should come to lectures since notes vary from term to term. Also his [se 380](http://davepagurek.github.io/SE-Notes/se380/index.html) is great.
