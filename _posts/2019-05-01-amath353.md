Taught by a [PhD graduate, Giuseppe](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/about/people/gsellaro) who just graduated.

He tried his best to make the course better: group discussion on midterms and so on. But final was hard because of tons of solving PDEs... Maybe should make the participation as the bonus.
