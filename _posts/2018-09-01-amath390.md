During this term, it was taught by a PhD student, Phillips, Brendon Christopher. He has some backgrounds (8 years) of music.

After I realized that
- It is math heavy, instead of focusing on music analysis,
- My lack of Fourier/DE knowledge,

I just audited for about 2~3 weeks. So I plan to take it 2 years later if no time conflicts.

One of my friends, who was taking it, told me that
> the course is not that hard. Projects take some time. Biweekly assignments. Previous knowledge on DE and Fourier transforms/series are assets.
