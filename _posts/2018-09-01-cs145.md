As I mentioned briefly in [cs 135](/17-09/CS135/), how this course looks like. Here I will say sth more.

The course covers so many topics like:
- basic CS 135
- lambda calculus (including Y-combinator)
- stream (lazy calculation: representing infinite sequence)
- CPU (RAM implementation and so on)

Much more abstract and 'useful' (if you study programming language theory). Assignments are more challenging as well.

After several weeks of lectures, I found I couldn't learn anything without doing assignments... If you are really into this course, consider taking [cs 442](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs442/), prof Ragde's [cs 245e](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/245/) and his grad courses on programming languages.
