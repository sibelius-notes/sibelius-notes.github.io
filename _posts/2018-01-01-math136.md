You can take the course with [Dan](http://wolczuk.com/): extremely passionate. He designed the course and the course notes (not free... but you can buy second-handed ones).

I took with Mukto Akash. He is nice: even giving lectures when he didn't feel well. However, you might suffer from copying his lecture notes: lots of examples without trimming... It is good but I was spending lots of my time just copying... As a result, he was behind other sessions several lectures, then he was only able to state the theorems during the last lecture without giving any examples.

I audited [Martin Pei](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mpei/)'s lectures for about 30 minutes. He was in a reasonable speed and reasonable amount of lecture notes. Hope I would take CO courses with him in the future.

# Remarks
This course did cover a good amount of linear algebra. However, I think it might be helpful if it covers a bit more abstract things to solid the idea of proof. Some techniques of proofs require more motivation and inspiration behind it... So consider taking math 146!
