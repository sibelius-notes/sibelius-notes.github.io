The notes above is made during winter 2021. Also check [winter 2020 notes](/pdf/1201/co331.pdf).


This is not a hard course. It requires some algebra. Also it needs some abstract algebra, which prof will have a chapter *Introduction to finite fields*. If you do all assignments, you will be fine on this course!

co487 focuses on a different part of whole coding process. It is not hard if you have a little maturity. It is more about a broad introduction in comparison to co485.
