This course is [Jim Geelen](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~jfgeelen/index.html)'s favourite course, instead of CO 446, because this course directly starts on theorems and proofs thanks to the foundations of previous courses. His offering during Fall 2012 can be found on [jlazovskis.com](http://www.jlazovskis.com/docs-ugrad/co442.pdf).

[Luke's version](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/sites/ca.combinatorics-and-optimization/files/uploads/files/graphtheoryoutline.pdf) has strong bias towards coloring, because of his research area.
