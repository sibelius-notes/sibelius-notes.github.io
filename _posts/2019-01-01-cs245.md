Took with [Lila Kari](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~lila/), who is famous is her research area: DNA. Then she spent 2 lectures on DNA.

Her slides are clear, but you should attend lectures to see how she tackled the examples since there are no solutions to examples on slides.

I think, in general, she made the course more organized.

On top of reading the slides, I also watched the videos of [cs 245e](/cs245e).
