..., [book version](/pdf/1201/co255_book.pdf), and [remastered version](/pdf/1201/co255_remastered.pdf) which is denser.

Here is the [proof](/pdf/1201/KKT-theorem.pdf) of KKT theorem (co 250 version).

This is a hard course no matter which prof is teaching it. Different prof has different focus: some on IP, some on graph stuff, some on NLP, but LP is a big part and much much harder than co 250.

Also if you are taking this course (or co 250), you will find some overlap with cs240/341 on some algorithm or complexity theory stuff.

In my opinion, the most interesting stuff was combinatorial optimization, which you will learn more in co450 and co351.
