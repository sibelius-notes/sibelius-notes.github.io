After I plan to pursue music minor, I find this credit is extremely useful!!

[University of Waterloo Choir](https://uwaterloo.ca/music/university-choir-audition-details) with [Gerard Yun](https://uwaterloo.ca/music/about/people/g4yun) and his [WLU profile](https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-music/faculty-profiles/gerard-yun/index.html). I will explain the first link [later](/2018/01/01/MUSIC117/).

Previously I thought choir is just church music... Then I found the choir can do so many things. We have done some jazz, and one arrangement from one Elgar's ‘Enigma’ Variations (believe it's finale) which is also studied in [music 255](/2018/01/01/MUSIC255/).

You need to social in the Choir... Talk with other people from different faculties, backgrounds. Music brings us together!


Also, there are [other ensembles](https://uwaterloo.ca/music/ensembles) available.
