This course spent a lot of time on introducing the foundation of wavelets: inner product space, Fourier and so on. Almost 1/4 of the course. But it is pretty cool when it comes to using wavelet to process the signal.

Lots of the materials are just for information due to the nature of this introductory course. I really don't have much time to go through all of these supplementary materials due to the limitation of time, but they are good to know if you are really interested in signal analysis.
