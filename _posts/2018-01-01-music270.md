The review notes is created during Fall 2019.

Taught by [Dr. P](https://uwaterloo.ca/music/people-profiles/terry-paynter-0). He was great. Sometimes he spent a whole lecture (1h 50mins) on writing a cantus or 4-part chorus as examples... At the beginning of each class, he played some improvised jazz in different styles.

The grade will be determined by lots of aspects: keyboard, singing, quizzes and so on. Get near 100% on each component then you should be fine.

From Fall 2018, the textbook switched from *Laitz, The complete Musician* to *Horton & Ritchey, Harmony Through Melody*. The hard copies are expensive for both.
