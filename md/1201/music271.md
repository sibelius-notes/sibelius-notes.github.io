# ยง 12: Tonic Confirmation
Review from [music 270](/music/270).

## Voice Leading
V or V<sup>7</sup> or vii<sup>6</sup> (chord of dominant function) &rarr; I (tonic)

- 2 &rarr; 1, 7 &rarr; 8, 4 &rarr; 3 (NOT with 5 &rarr; 3)
- 5 &rarr; 1 or 8 (In bass at final cadence)
- 5 &rarr; 3, 5 &rarr; 5, 2 &rarr; 3, 2 &rarr; 5

Root position of vii is not allowed (because it is diminished), but first inversion vii<sup>6</sup> is a chord of dominant function.

## Chords by function
- Within music
    - Elaborative Chords (Pre-Dominant) = II, IV, VI, III
    - Chords of Dom FUnction = V, VII<sup>6</sup>
- At Cadence 
    - Pre-Cadenttial-Dominants: II, IV, VI
    - Cadential 6/4: I64 but over V
    - Dominant = V or V<sup>7</sup>

## Steps to complete Tonal Homophony
1. Analyze the Soprano
2. Sketch the Bass
3. Complete the Bass
4. Complete the Cadence
5. Add inner voices

# ยง 14: Tonicization
Tonicization: Music shifts (momentarily) from its primary tonic to another key

Modulation: Music shifts keys for a complete section of music

A Tonicization can be slightly longer by establishing a new key of a phrase Cadence.

The process of tonicization enables us to explore the tonality of a particular key, to enter more fully into it. Any consonant chord of the key can lay claim to the music's tonal focus as a temporary center, or **local tonic**.

## Melodic Analysis
We would need to analyze the soprano to find any tonicizing patterns. See Example 14.15 in textbook. For example, half step ascending can be viewed as 7 &rarr; 8 in the context of tonicizing major or minor chord. After analysis, we get the chart like Example 14.16.

Also we can have prolongation patterns, given in Example 14.22.

Conjunctive chords play a limited role in note-against-note tonicized settings, usually only one at a time. They coordinate conjunctions in the chordal grammar. See Example 14.24.

## Composing a Tonicized Homophony
1. Analyze the Soprano - Finding tonicizing patterns (above) and prolongation Patterns (below)
2. Choose harmonic Path from chart
3. Sketch the bass (through cadence)
4. Complete bass (through cadence)
5. Add tenor and alto

Avoid P5 &rarr; P5

## Harmonic Elision
Compress the normal syntax, such omissions (called ellipses) serve to accelerate and intensify our language. When applied to music, it is called harmonic elision.

The bass plays the primary role in harmonic elision and *will move through the paired dominant-function chords by step*. (move in and out...)

# ยง 15: Elaborating the Lower Voices
## Accented Dissonance
- Whole notes are consonant
- Half-notes between chords can be dissonant *IF* approached by step
- Half-notes between chords MUST be consonant if jumped or leapt to a chord tone.
- Decorating with Diss
    - SUS 
        - 4 - 3 and 7 - 6 and 9 - 8 in Alto or tenor
        - 9 - 10 in Bass


## Diminished Seventh
In D major:

## Ways to Decorate
1. Melodic Figures
    - If leaping (SS, BC, Arp...) Must be a chord tone.
    - Passing (P) and Neighbor (N) Can be dissonant (Non-chord tone)
2. Accented Dissonance
    - Suspensions (SUS) 4 - 3, 7 - 6, 9 - 8, 9 - 10
    - Rhythmic Displacement (RD)
        - 3 or 4-note passing
        - 3 or 4-note neighbor
3. Weak beat chords
    1. Extend Strong-beat chord (V<sup>7</sup> - vii<sup>o7</sup>)
    2. Add an elaborative chord
    3. Add a tonicizing chord

Between Cadential Predominant (<span>&#92;(\text{C} _ 4^6 &#92;)</span> or V) and Dom, can use II (major only), II<sup>6</sup>, II<sup>7</sup>, <span>&#92;(\text{II} _ 5^6 &#92;)</span>, IV, IV<sup>6</sup>, IV<sup>7</sup>

From Final V to I
1. a 4-3 SUS
2. A descending octave leap in bass
3. Create V<sup>7</sup> on weak-beat

# ยง 16: Chorale
The **chorale** originated in sixteenth-century Germany as a product of the Reformation. The reformers undertook to provide sacred songs in the vernacular for unison singing as a means of actively involving the people in the church's liturgy.

## Phrase Cadences
## Perfect Authentic Cadence
Sop ends on 1. Root V - Root I.

Primary tonic at FINAL CADENCE. Local Tonic at any Internal Cadence.

- Sop: 2 - 1 or 7 - 8
- Bass: 5 - 1 (8)
- Chord: V<sup>(7)</sup> - I

## Imperfect Authentic Cadence
Sop ends on 3 or 5. Root V - Root I.

Both Primary & Local Tonics

- Sop: 2 - 3, 5 - 3, 4 - 3, 5 - 5
- Bass: 5 - 1 (8)
- Chord: V<sup>(7)</sup> - I
