# Lecture 1
## Part A: Welcome To The Show!
This course is about music and movies and what happened when they put together.

Textbook is like Google Earth view. Listening to lectures is like Google street view.
 
And I’ll see you again in Part B.  

## Part B: Our First Scene
This is the music written specifically for the scene. The film has already been chopped and the composer was writing music while watching the film on fold. The composer has synchronized the music they have written to what goes on within the scene. Watch the scene with the sound off. Then listen to the music with the sound on. VIDEO EXAMPLE 1-Apollo 13.

The first part shows the wife of one of the astronauts in a hotel. She is nervous cause her husband is going to the moon. She's scared that he's never come back. While she's in the shower, the wedding ring slides off her finger and goes down the drain. It manifests the wife's fear of losing her husband. No music during shower scene. Why? 
- Small, intimate scene. Music would risk over-dramatizing. 
- Leave “space” for what follows. After this scene, music continues for several minutes through the launch scene.

  
Where music “isn’t” can be as important as where it is. 
Music fades in under shower scene – smoothes transitions.  

- Instruments: 
    - Brass – military – heroism – sacrifice 
    - Synthesizer Bass - Technology 
- Style: Chorale – Protestant Hymn – faith – sacrifice 
- Tempo: Slow – restrained – controlled – professional 
- Change in musical texture with transition to external scene.
