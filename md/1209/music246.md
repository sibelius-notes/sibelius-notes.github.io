# Lecture 1
## Part A: Welcome To The Show!
This course is about music and movies and what happened when they put together.

Textbook is like Google Earth view. Listening to lectures is like Google street view.

And I’ll see you again in Part B.  

## Part B: Our First Scene
This is the music written specifically for the scene. The film has already been chopped and the composer was writing music while watching the film on fold. The composer has synchronized the music they have written to what goes on within the scene. Watch the scene with the sound off. Then listen to the music with the sound on. VIDEO EXAMPLE 1-Apollo 13.

{% include video.html path="/video/Video Example 1-Apollo 13.mp4" %}

The first part shows the wife of one of the astronauts in a hotel. She is nervous cause her husband is going to the moon. She's scared that he's never come back. While she's in the shower, the wedding ring slides off her finger and goes down the drain. It manifests the wife's fear of losing her husband. No music during shower scene. Why?
- Small, intimate scene. Music would risk over-dramatizing.
- Leave “space” for what follows. After this scene, music continues for several minutes through the launch scene.


Where music “isn’t” can be as important as where it is.
Music fades in under shower scene – smoothes transitions.  

- Instruments:
    - Brass – military – heroism – sacrifice
    - Synthesizer Bass - Technology
- Style: Chorale – Protestant Hymn – faith – sacrifice
- Tempo: Slow – restrained – controlled – professional
- Change in musical texture with transition to external scene.

## Part C: The Four Functions
Now let's take a look at an example of how music can alter perceptions of things. Mrs Doubtfire: [Original Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqxpC_jYncE); [Fake horror trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckv_Dz-Sio).

Any visual image, and put any piece of music on it, sth will happen. This will vary from viewer to viewer, listener to listener, depending on the background. But usually, when director and composer sit down and decide on what the music is going to do within the context of a particular film, they want the audience to notice/feel some particular things.

What is a movie? What is a film? Why is there the music in the first place? We are going to focus on the most common, generally, narrative film: tells a story, in a coherent, consistent manner.

Suspension of disbelief. Like a contract between the audience and the film makers. It says: Ok director, I gonna accept what you show is real. The one thing that film maker cannot do is drawing attention to the fact that what you are watching isn't real. For example, inconsistency between scenes. Avoid all these things and present the audience a world that is believable, consistent, real. Then, over the top of it, we have music. We don't have music in real life. It would be nice if we have music IRL: it will tell us when we will have trouble or succeed in some situations. And yet, we got music all over the films. So shouldn't music be like those continuity errors (inconsistency)? It's something telling us the people in the film world can't hear the music, but we can, which is artificial.  Music does become a very common part of film making. So why is it there?

**The Four Functions**
1.	Music can create a more convincing atmosphere of time and place.
    -	historical, cultural, geographical – BUT based on western conventions.
2.	Music can underline or create psychological refinements.
    -	the unspoken thoughts of a character or the unseen implications of a situation.
3.	Music can provide a sense of continuity in a film.
    -	structure of music “smoothes over” the discontinuous, chaotic nature of film.
4.	Music can provide the underpinning for the theatrical buildup of a scene and then round it off with a sense of finality.
    -	music can affect the “pacing” of a scene.

# Lecture 2
EVALUATING A SCORE:
How do we talk about what we hear?

**Diegesis** (叙事): The world of the narrative. All characters, events, etc depicted, suggested, or described.

**Diegetic Music**: 画内音
- music whose source is within the Diegesis.
-	heard both by the characters within the narrative and the film audience.
-	also known as “source music,” “direct music,” or “foreground music.”
-	Functions include: establishing time and place, creating a sense of “realism and immediacy,” offering ironic comment.

**Nondiegetic Music**: 画外音
-	heard by the film audience only.
-	Referred to as the “score,” “underscore,” or "background music".
-	Normally originally composed for the specific film (original score).
-	May also included preexisting music “adapted” for the film.

Difference between score and sound track. Score: music written specifically for accompanying the film, usually written after the film is shot. Sound track: collection of preexisting popular songs.

An example of adapting music: [The Sting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCfflhAHbT0) (1973) Music of Scott Joplin, adapted by Marvin Hamlisch.

May also include preexisting music used without adaption, Example: Platoon (1986) Composer: George Deleure, also includes Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings (1938). Also used in The Elephant Man (1980) and Sicko (2007).

Example: [Platoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEv3zzKyiFQ) (1986) Using the “Adagio For Strings” by Samuel Barber

All preexisting music, “Compiled Score.” is all music in the score are preexisting music without alteration. Such as the music used in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Compiled from the works of R. Strauss, J Strauss, etc ...

Now we describe the music.
## Style
-	what type of music has the composer chosen?
-	what type of instruments?
-	how do these choices relate to the film as a whole?

Restoration (1995) Composer: James Newton Howard
-	set in the mid 1600s.
-	Score is part original part adapted, based on the work of Henry Purcell, an important composer of the period.
-	Use of period instruments including Harpsichord.
- [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psna8iUfYWQ): Restoration (1995) Music by James Newton Howard, based on a theme by Henry Purcell

Local Hero (1983) Composer: Mark Knopfler.
-	plot follows an urban American in a small Scottish village.
-	blend of folk and popular styles.
-	emphasis on instruments such as the guitar.
-	Knopfler developed melodies similar to Anglo Celtic folk music
- [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiNSCKtfVos): Local Hero (1983) Music by Mark Knopfler

The Godfather (1972) Composer: Nino Rota
-	follows the life of an organized crime family.
-	much of the instrumentation and melodies based on the folk music of Sicily.
- solo brass, not military, not heroic, sounds mournful, tragic, alone.

## Concept
-	is the music used in a consistent manner throughout the film?
-	What is accompanied? What is left without accompaniment?
-	What “motivates” the music? Action, characters, events, objects, flashbacks, etc...

Conceptual Approaches:
Most film music will fall somewhere between two extremes:
1.	Playing the Drama
    -	music attempts to reinforce primarily emotional elements within the narrative.
2.	Hitting the Action
    -	music accents visual events: car chases and so on.
    -	common approach to cartoon scoring.
    -	“Mickey Mousing”.

## Musical Characteristics
1. Melody or Theme
    -	Considered the most “recognizable” music element for western ears.
    -	Do characters, objects or situations have a particular melody associated with them?
    -	German Opera composer Richard Wagner – Leitmotive.
    -	Melodies can be taken through a number of variations to tell you what is going on within a particular character – thoughts or feelings etc…
    -	Are the melodies easy to hum, or are they “angular” and more difficult? If a melody is associated with sth positive within the film world, then it would be a bit easier to hum, smoother. More angular, harder, then on the dangerous/less desirable side. This "rule" is quite generalized...

2. Tempo or Pulse: how fast does the music unfold, how quick is the beat?
    -	How does the speed of the music influence the “tempo” of the narrative?
    -	On-screen action, framing, editing, sound design.
