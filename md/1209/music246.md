# Lecture 1
## Part A: Welcome To The Show!
This course is about music and movies and what happened when they put together.

Textbook is like Google Earth view. Listening to lectures is like Google street view.

And I’ll see you again in Part B.  

## Part B: Our First Scene
This is the music written specifically for the scene. The film has already been chopped and the composer was writing music while watching the film on fold. The composer has synchronized the music they have written to what goes on within the scene. Watch the scene with the sound off. Then listen to the music with the sound on. VIDEO EXAMPLE 1-Apollo 13.

The first part shows the wife of one of the astronauts in a hotel. She is nervous cause her husband is going to the moon. She's scared that he's never come back. While she's in the shower, the wedding ring slides off her finger and goes down the drain. It manifests the wife's fear of losing her husband. No music during shower scene. Why?
- Small, intimate scene. Music would risk over-dramatizing.
- Leave “space” for what follows. After this scene, music continues for several minutes through the launch scene.


Where music “isn’t” can be as important as where it is.
Music fades in under shower scene – smoothes transitions.  

- Instruments:
    - Brass – military – heroism – sacrifice
    - Synthesizer Bass - Technology
- Style: Chorale – Protestant Hymn – faith – sacrifice
- Tempo: Slow – restrained – controlled – professional
- Change in musical texture with transition to external scene.

## Part C: The Four Functions
Now let's take a look at an example of how music can alter perceptions of things. Mrs Doubtfire: [Original Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqxpC_jYncE); [Fake horror trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckv_Dz-Sio).

Any visual image, and put any piece of music on it, sth will happen. This will vary from viewer to viewer, listener to listener, depending on the background. But usually, when director and composer sit down and decide on what the music is going to do within the context of a particular film, they want the audience to notice/feel some particular things.

What is a movie? What is a film? Why is there the music in the first place? We are going to focus on the most common, generally, narrative film: tells a story, in a coherent, consistent manner.

Suspension of disbelief. Like a contract between the audience and the film makers. It says: Ok director, I gonna accept what you show is real. The one thing that film maker cannot do is drawing attention to the fact that what you are watching isn't real. For example, inconsistency between scenes. Avoid all these things and present the audience a world that is believable, consistent, real. Then, over the top of it, we have music. We don't have music in real life. It would be nice if we have music IRL: it will tell us when we will have trouble or succeed in some situations. And yet, we got music all over the films. So shouldn't music be like those continuity errors (inconsistency)? It's something telling us the people in the film world can't hear the music, but we can, which is artificial.  Music does become a very common part of film making. So why is it there?

**The Four Functions**
1.	Music can create a more convincing atmosphere of time and place.
    -	historical, cultural, geographical – BUT based on western conventions.
2.	Music can underline or create psychological refinements.
    -	the unspoken thoughts of a character or the unseen implications of a situation.
3.	Music can provide a sense of continuity in a film.
    -	structure of music “smoothes over” the discontinuous, chaotic nature of film.
4.	Music can provide the underpinning for the theatrical buildup of a scene and then round it off with a sense of finality.
    -	music can affect the “pacing” of a scene.
