# Motion
## Inertia
A body in motion tends to remain in motion; a body in rest tends to remain at rest.
How to describe motion?
- Position: Where you are
- Velocity: 2 parts:
    - 1.) How fast you are going (speed)
    - 2.) Which way you are going (direction)
- Acceleration: How fast your velocity is changing: Speeding up, Slowing down, Changing direction

## Newton's law
- First Law: An object that is not subject to any outside
forces moves at constant velocity, covering equal
distances in equal times along a straight line path.
- Second Law: The force exerted on an object is equal to
the product of the objectâ€™s mass times its acceleration.
The acceleration is in the same direction of the force
    - F = ma
    - Easier to move a light object than a heavy one
- Third Law: For every force that one object exerts on a
second object, there is an equal but oppositely
directed force that the second objects exerts on the
first object.

## Gravity
A man standing on the ground, not moving, no acceleration. By Newton's second law, 0 force. Does not mean no gravity. Think of all forces, there's normal force from floor pointing upwards. These two forces cancel out.

Consider falling ball. <span>&#92;(F=mg=ma \implies g=a&#92;)</span>. Acceleration independent of mass. Feather falls as fast as a lead brick.

## Energy
is ability to do work/damage. Two energy:
- potential (stored): Higher has more potential energy.
- kinetic (moving): Faster moving has more kinetic energy.

## Work
is how you transfer energy. work = force <span>&#92;(\times &#92;)</span> distance. If you are not pushing or it is not moving, then you are not working.

## Momentum
is tendency to continue moving in a certain direction. More momentum: Tend to win in collisions

Momentum = Mass <span>&#92;(\times &#92;)</span> Velocity

## Friction
How to push a block. Gravity = normal force (block not falling). Push force - friction = ma (the block accelerate)

Friction slows the motion. Push force needs to be greater than friction for motion to occur. Friction only resists the motion.

Two kinds of friction
1. Static friction: Not moving; Keeps the object in place (desk on the floor)
2. Kinetic friction: while moving

Generally static friction is bigger than kinetic hard to get the motion started

Friction force does work <span>&#92;(\to &#92;)</span> HEAT

## Circular Motion
Constant speed, but the direction of velocity changes. It is always accelerating. Thus requires an inward force, pointing towards the center of the circle. <span>&#92;(F=mv^2/R &#92;)</span>. Bigger radius, smaller force. Bigger velocity, larger force.

Car going around a corner/circle. No strings, where does that inner force come from? friction between tire and road.
Well, there's force pushing me towards the center, but I feel I am being thrown out of the car while turning left. Is there a force pushing me out of the car? No. Imagine the seats are slippery. Then the person is moving straight but the car is going left by Newton's first law.

Demo here shows the conservation of angular momentum. If it keeps spinning, it doesn't fall. If it slows down, then gravity takes over.

Another demo shows momentum of inertia. We cannot change the mass, but we change the distribution: by moving mass further away/closer to the center. Putting hands and legs, it becomes faster.

## Bucket
Hold a bucket of water and rotate it around your head, the water doesn't fall when the bucket is above your head. It goes fast enough, the force needed is greater than the gravity, then the water stays. If the gravitational force is smaller than that
required for circular motion, the bucket will
exert more force on the water to keep it
moving in a circle.

# Resonance
Demo: wine glass with straw inside. Round circle speaker at the back, amplifier. We can see straw going back and forth, and finally the glasses breaks.

## Travelling Waves
Pulse on a string.

![there should be a image...](/pics/pulse.png)

Can have a wave travelling down
the string OR can have a standing
wave.

Demo: fix a rope at one end and hold on the other end. The pulse hits that end and comes back upside down. If we pull tight, create more tension, it travels more faster. The pulse carries the energy.

- Transverse Oscillations: String moves up and down forming a wave
that travels along the string, similar to waves in the ocean
- Longitudinal Oscillation:
    - Pressure (= Force divided by Area) is a force exerted over an area.
    - Strong force on a large area has same pressure as  weak force on a small area
    - Sound is an example of this type of wave. Regions of low pressure and high pressure. Can see compression and expansion in different places.

Speed of a wave = Frequency <span>&#92;(\times &#92;)</span> Wavelength

Why does string move
up and down? Restoring force
from tension in
the string

## Doppler Effect
Change in Train Whistle.
- Train not moving, Wavelength <span>&#92;(L &#92;)</span>, Frequency <span>&#92;(f &#92;)</span>
- Train moving right, towards you. Wavelength smaller, freq higher.
- Train moving left, away from you. Wavelength larger, freq lower.

Speed of sound constant. Waves get compressed or expanded

## Pendulum
- String pulls the mass to the right
- The mass keeps moving, past the bottom and off to the right
- The string then pulls the mass to the left
- The mass goes back and forth
- Restoring force: always tries to bring the mass to equilibrium
- Simple Harmonic Oscillator
- Period of pendulum ( Time
to go back and forth) only
depends on length of the
string
- Long string, long period,
low frequency

## Harmonic Oscillator
Mass on a spring
- Start with spring stretched
- Spring pulls mass to the left
- Spring gets squeezed and pushes the mass to the
right
- Spring applies a restoring force to the mass (tries to
place the mass so the string is unstretched and
relaxed 
- Frequency depends on mass and the stiffness of the
spring
- Bigger mass, lower
frequency. Stiffer spring, higher
frequency
