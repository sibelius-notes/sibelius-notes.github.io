# Motion
## Inertia
A body in motion tends to remain in motion; a body in rest tends to remain at rest.
How to describe motion?
- Position: Where you are
- Velocity: 2 parts:
    - 1.) How fast you are going (speed)
    - 2.) Which way you are going (direction)
- Acceleration: How fast your velocity is changing: Speeding up, Slowing down, Changing direction

## Newton's law
- First Law: An object that is not subject to any outside
forces moves at constant velocity, covering equal
distances in equal times along a straight line path.
- Second Law: The force exerted on an object is equal to
the product of the object’s mass times its acceleration.
The acceleration is in the same direction of the force
    - F = ma
    - Easier to move a light object than a heavy one
- Third Law: For every force that one object exerts on a
second object, there is an equal but oppositely
directed force that the second objects exerts on the
first object.

## Gravity
A man standing on the ground, not moving, no acceleration. By Newton's second law, 0 force. Does not mean no gravity. Think of all forces, there's normal force from floor pointing upwards. These two forces cancel out.

Consider falling ball. <span>&#92;(F=mg=ma \implies g=a&#92;)</span>. Acceleration independent of mass. Feather falls as fast as a lead brick.

## Energy
is ability to do work/damage. Two energy:
- potential (stored): Higher has more potential energy.
- kinetic (moving): Faster moving has more kinetic energy.

## Work
is how you transfer energy. work = force <span>&#92;(\times &#92;)</span> distance. If you are not pushing or it is not moving, then you are not working.

## Momentum
is tendency to continue moving in a certain direction. More momentum: Tend to win in collisions

Momentum = Mass <span>&#92;(\times &#92;)</span> Velocity

## Friction
How to push a block. Gravity = normal force (block not falling). Push force - friction = ma (the block accelerate)

Friction slows the motion. Push force needs to be greater than friction for motion to occur. Friction only resists the motion.

Two kinds of friction
1. Static friction: Not moving; Keeps the object in place (desk on the floor)
2. Kinetic friction: while moving

Generally static friction is bigger than kinetic hard to get the motion started

Friction force does work <span>&#92;(\to &#92;)</span> HEAT

## Circular Motion
Constant speed, but the direction of velocity changes. It is always accelerating. Thus requires an inward force, pointing towards the center of the circle. <span>&#92;(F=mv^2/R &#92;)</span>. Bigger radius, smaller force. Bigger velocity, larger force.

Car going around a corner/circle. No strings, where does that inner force come from? friction between tire and road.
Well, there's force pushing me towards the center, but I feel I am being thrown out of the car while turning left. Is there a force pushing me out of the car? No. Imagine the seats are slippery. Then the person is moving straight but the car is going left by Newton's first law.

Demo here shows the conservation of angular momentum. If it keeps spinning, it doesn't fall. If it slows down, then gravity takes over.

Another demo shows momentum of inertia. We cannot change the mass, but we change the distribution: by moving mass further away/closer to the center. Putting hands and legs, it becomes faster.

## Bucket
Hold a bucket of water and rotate it around your head, the water doesn't fall when the bucket is above your head. It goes fast enough, the force needed is greater than the gravity, then the water stays. If the gravitational force is smaller than that
required for circular motion, the bucket will
exert more force on the water to keep it
moving in a circle.

# Resonance
Demo: wine glass with straw inside. Round circle speaker at the back, amplifier. We can see straw going back and forth, and finally the glasses breaks.

## Travelling Waves
Pulse on a string.

![there should be a image...](/pics/pulse.png)

Can have a wave travelling down
the string OR can have a standing
wave.

Demo: fix a rope at one end and hold on the other end. The pulse hits that end and comes back upside down. If we pull tight, create more tension, it travels more faster. The pulse carries the energy.

- Transverse Oscillations: String moves up and down forming a wave
that travels along the string, similar to waves in the ocean
- Longitudinal Oscillation:
    - Pressure (= Force divided by Area) is a force exerted over an area.
    - Strong force on a large area has same pressure as  weak force on a small area
    - Sound is an example of this type of wave. Regions of low pressure and high pressure. Can see compression and expansion in different places.

Speed of a wave = Frequency <span>&#92;(\times &#92;)</span> Wavelength

Why does string move
up and down? Restoring force
from tension in
the string

## Doppler Effect
Change in Train Whistle.
- Train not moving, Wavelength <span>&#92;(L &#92;)</span>, Frequency <span>&#92;(f &#92;)</span>
- Train moving right, towards you. Wavelength smaller, freq higher.
- Train moving left, away from you. Wavelength larger, freq lower.

Speed of sound constant. Waves get compressed or expanded

## Pendulum
- String pulls the mass to the right
- The mass keeps moving, past the bottom and off to the right
- The string then pulls the mass to the left
- The mass goes back and forth
- Restoring force: always tries to bring the mass to equilibrium
- Simple Harmonic Oscillator
- Period of pendulum ( Time
to go back and forth) only
depends on length of the
string
- Long string, long period,
low frequency

## Harmonic Oscillator
Mass on a spring
- Start with spring stretched
- Spring pulls mass to the left
- Spring gets squeezed and pushes the mass to the
right
- Spring applies a restoring force to the mass (tries to
place the mass so the string is unstretched and
relaxed
- Frequency depends on mass and the stiffness of the
spring
- Bigger mass, lower
frequency. Stiffer spring, higher
frequency

## Resonance
Example: child on the swing and push the child. That's pendulum. Because of the friction, eventually stop. If you take phys 112, then you will know the period changes if the amplitude becomes large enough.

You can't push in any given time. Always push just as the swing moving away from you. Pushing does the work, which increase the mechanical energy. Here the kinetic energy gets increased, moving faster. At the top, lots of gravitational potential energy.
If we push when it comes towards me, we decrease the kinetic energy.

Oscillators have a natural frequency at which they
prefer to oscillate. This is the resonant frequency of the oscillator.  If energy is applied to the oscillator at the same
frequency, the amplitude of the oscillation will
increase.

## Standing Waves
string instruments. If string has two fixed ends, the waves will travel and hit the end and comes back flipped upside down. We got some waves travelling to the right, and some to the left. There are some interference. We see the sum of waves. String can't move on two ends. For some specific freq, we see standing waves.

![there should be a image...](/pics/sdwave.png)

Demo: 5 hz is the fundamental freq, first harmonic. 10 hz we see the second. 15 hz is the third, 3 antinodes.

In guitar, we got fret. Changing the fret, we can adjust the length of the string. Speed constant, wavelength
different so frequency different
(harmonics)

## Wine Glass
The sound makes the glass vibrating. Plastic cup will not likely break because energy could loss in the cup. Little energy loss in good wine glass for every oscillation of the cup.

- Rub finger along the rim of glass get friction
- Stick / slip causes rim of wine glass to move
- Size and shape of the glass determine the natural frequency
- Rubbing finger adds energy and makes sound louder
- Similar to bow on a violin

![there should be a image...](/pics/wineglass.png)

Bowl of wine glass
moves in and out like a
water balloon. This
moves air back and
forth, producing a
pressure wave SOUND

## Sounds from a Tube
In wind instruments, sound is little different. In the pipe, we have standing waves of the actual air.

- Pressure differences in tube provide a
restoring force
- Simple harmonic oscillator
- Fundamental wavelength is twice length
of tube
- Blow air across bottom of tube
- Adds energy to resonator, coupling complicated
- Air moves in and
out at the ends

Demo: freq depends the length of the column of air.  The temperature and density of gas affect the speed of sound.

## Sound from a beer bottle
Behaves like a mass on a spring.
Air in a bottle is the mass.
Air in the large part of the bottle
provides the restoring forces as it
expands and contracts.

Adding liquid to the bottle decreases the size
of the air compartment, changes restoring
force and therefore the frequency

## Loud Speaker

![there should be a image...](/pics/speaker.png)

The pressure wave is created by the
speaker cone moving back and forth.

# Pressure
## Gas
Inside the air, we have oxygen molecules, nitrogen. Can be single atoms or
molecules. All molecules are moving fast, and bouncing off each other. Different from liquid. Solid, molecules are regularly aligned.
## Pressure
Where does pressure comes from?

![there should be a image...](/pics/pressure.png)

We have a bunch of gas particles bouncing around the box. Some of them are bouncing off the walls in the box. Molecules have mass. When they hit the wall, there's a collision, some force applied to the wall. So there's a force pushing outwards on the box. Rather than talking about the force pushing the box, we talk about the pressure, which is <span>&#92;(force/area &#92;)</span>. That's a property of a gas, which is independent of the size of the box/area.

How we can change the pressure? We can change the pressure by changing the density. Or temperature. Higher the temperature, faster those particles are moving, more kinetic energy, faster motion, more force, greater pressure.

Density is how many particles I have in certain amount of volume. More particles inside the box, more collisions with the walls, more force, higher pressure.

## Ideal Gas Law
Combine what we already know
<span>&#92;[
    PV = nRT
&#92;]</span>
where P is pressure, V is volume, n is number of moles, R is constant (fudge factor), T is temperature. Pressure is proportional to density of
particles times temperature.

## Atmosphere
Why do we have atmosphere pressure. There's gradual transmission between atmosphere and space. Gravity is giving us gravity air pressure.

![there should be a image...](/pics/atmos.png)

 Let's take a little box of air. Each stacks on each other. The gas has some weight.

What does pressure really mean?
- Atmospheric pressure at sea level:
100,000 newtons per square meter, 100, 000 pascals (Pa)
(~10,000 kg per square meter or 14.7 pounds per square inch)
- Pressure at Denver: 83,000 Pa (12.2 psi)
- Pressure at Chomolungma (Mount Everest): 33,000 Pa (4.9 psi)
- At sea level, equivalent to a bus on top of you
or 1 ton per square foot
- Pressure difference between top and bottom of wing
2, 000 Pa (1/3 psi)

So we have ~10000kg air on us. Why we are not flattened into a pancake? It turns out air pressure presses us on all sides. Equally from all sides. We are made up of water. Water is compressible.

## Hydraulic Pump
![there should be a image...](/pics/hydra.png)

## Buoyancy
![there should be a image...](/pics/buoyancy.png)

Archimedes’ Principle: An object partially or
wholly immersed in a fluid is acted upon by an
upward buoyant force equal to the weight of
the fluid it displaces.

Consider part of the fluid: Total Force = force up – force down – force of gravity = 0

If the object has a different mass, the
force of gravity will be different
- if mass is greater than the fluid.
Total Force is negative,
object falls
- if mass is less than the fluid.
Total Force is positive,
object goes up
- if mass is the same
Total Force = 0, object
stays where is

## Hot Air Balloon
Floating through the sky. Fire burner at the bottom, which heats the air. The bottom of the balloon is completely open. Air can come in and out. Why does hot air balloon go up? The density of the hot air balloon must be less than the density of the air. How's that possible? The key is the fire. When we heat up the air inside the balloon, the temperature gets higher, the kinetic energy of the air particles gets larger. Then the pressure goes up, but the bottom is open. Air will then come out from the bottom. The density inside will decrease significantly.

pressure inside = pressure outside because of the hole on the bottom.

The density of the balloon then decreases. Pressure is proportional to density times temperature.
Hot air has higher temperature and same pressure so
density is lower. So weight of balloon is less than the air. Then balloon rises.

## Regular Balloon
First, prof blows up a balloon. Pressure inside > pressure outside, because it needs to stretch balloon. We are doing work to inflate the balloon. Tension on balloon
produces inward force,
pressure of balloon
provides outward force
to balance.

## Helium Balloon
Force due to gravity = weight of balloon + weight of helium

**If**
weight of helium is less than
weight of air (yes)
**and**
weight of helium + weight of
balloon is less than weight of
air (depends on balloon)
**then**
balloon goes up

## Bubbles
A bubble is made up of soap and water. Surfactant molecules (SOAP)

![there should be a image...](/pics/bubble.png)

Why do bubbles pop? Water inside stablizes the bilayer. As water vaporizes, it starts to thin the membrane. Until the membrane is not strong enough, then it corrupts.
