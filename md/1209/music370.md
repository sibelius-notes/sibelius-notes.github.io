# §22: Minuet
Review on chapter 22 and 6,4 chords.

# §23: Primary mixture
Primary mixture on major keys/ minor keys.

Tonicization represent the broadest application of chromatics in major-minor tonality. But chromaticism need not always serve the interests of tonicization: we can intensify the harmonic events in a major-key or minor-key by introducing chords borrowed from the parallel mode. This process is called **primary mixture**.

## PM in Major
lowering <span>&#92;(\hat 6 &#92;)</span> (and <span>&#92;(\hat 3 &#92;)</span>)

Pre-dominant chords, mixture in tonic prolongation, plagal cadence

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/b13167b34e?outputOnly=true&start=result" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## PM in minor
Picardy third: raise <span>&#92;(\hat 3 &#92;)</span> in the cadential I

When the Phrygian and minor modes are notated on the same tonic, their tonic patterns differ only in respect to the placement of their second degrees. **Phrygian II chord** can be introduced in a minor key by lowering <span>&#92;(\hat 2 &#92;)</span>. The Phrygian II appears most often as a sixth chord in minor, where it is commonly called a **Neapolitan 6th**. We frequently meet the Neapolitan 6th as a pre-dominant chord.

Example: N6
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/8d95d17acc?outputOnly=true&start=result" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The Phrygian II (the root-position chord) rarely appears as a pre-dominant harmony, owing to the discordant tritone leap in bass from <span>&#92;(\flat \hat 2\to\hat 5 &#92;)</span> (the dominant root). However, the Phrygian II can be introduced to enrich prolongations of minor chords in both modes.

## homophony with PM

Elaborate chord, could do PM.

If soprano 7-8, 2-1, 4-3, we can do deceptive resolution. 2-3 doesn't work cause it creates parallel fifth. With decoration, 2-4-3 in soprano avoids parallel fifth.

Minor prolongation including Neapolitan flat 6 on weak beat.

Subdominant prolongation (in primary tonic), PM.

PM in cadence. Before that, IV or II chord, can do PM.

After this, do a Plagal Cadence.

### Steps

- Step 1: Analyze a soprano, choose harmonic path and consider PM
- Step 2: Compose a decorated bass.
  - soprano 1 2 3, bass 3 2 1
- Step 3: Elaborate the soprano
- Step 4: Add Inner Voices
  - not half diminished in minor key, only fully diminished
- Step 5: decorated plagal cadence

If do a minor homophony, for chapter 23. Don't apply plagal cadence in minor. It doesn't help. End in major.

Soprano: Once you hit the final tonic with ties, just stay on that.

# §24: Intensifying the Dominant
## The Augmented 6th chords
Not tonicize, but intensify this motion to the dominant.

soprano: 8 7 8. bass: b6 5 1. Then introduce third voice, #4, which is A4 above the bass. Then fourth voice:
- double the third: Italian <span>&#92;(^6_3 &#92;)</span>
- enters on <span>&#92;(\hat 2 &#92;)</span>, French <span>&#92;(^4_3 &#92;)</span>
- perfect fifth above the bass (<span>&#92;(\hat 3 &#92;)</span> in minor, <span>&#92;(\flat \hat 3 &#92;)</span> in major), German <span>&#92;(^6_5 &#92;)</span>. Note the unavoidable parallel fifth as 3<span>&#92;(\to &#92;)</span>2.

Italian 63

## More on A6
It has always to resolve to dominant, but doesn't always have to be on the strong beat.

These are embellishing chords, not pre-dominant, not elaborate.

Interpolated <span>&#92;(C _ 4 ^ 6 &#92;)</span>:
- Major: <span>&#92;(\flat 3\to \natural 3 \to 2 \to 1 \text{ or } 3 &#92;)</span>
- Minor: no change on 3 since 3 has been flatted

Ex 24.18 The enharmonic German <span>&#92;(^6_5 &#92;)</span>, only in major.

Ex 24.27 Noncadential A6

## Common-Tone Diminished 7th
another embellishing chord.

only works in major key.

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/f663a50f14?outputOnly=true&start=result" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Ex 24.29: CT is creating chromatism to chordal 3rd (<span>&#92;(\hat 7 &#92;)</span>), chordal 5th (<span>&#92;(\hat 2 &#92;)</span>): <span>&#92;(\sharp \hat 6\to \hat 7, \sharp \hat 1 \to \hat 2 &#92;)</span>.

In summary for CT<span>&#92;(^\circ &#92;)</span>7 voice leading is:
- <span>&#92;(\sharp 6 \to 7 &#92;)</span>
- <span>&#92;(\sharp 1 \to 2 &#92;)</span>
- <span>&#92;(5\to 5 &#92;)</span> (the common tone!)
- <span>&#92;(3\to 2 &#92;)</span> for V and V<sup>6</sup> or <span>&#92;(3\to 4 &#92;)</span> for V<sup>7</sup> and all inversions

## T3A-05
Step 1: correct homophony from chapter 19.

Step 2: Where can new chords go? PM, A6, CT<sup>o</sup>7 (remember this has to be in Major)

Step 3: Remove some decoration, and allow for a slight reworking places where PM, Aug 6 and CT<sup>o</sup>7 can work

Step 4: Get the framework set-up again, with new harmonization altering what is needed to allow for PM as well. Insert CT<sup>o</sup>

Step 5: Fill in the inner voices, and make sure the voice leading works and is pleasing!

# §25: Intensifying the Tonic
## The Augmented Dominant
Only available in major. Better to use on a weak beat, cause might create A2 in the voice leading. <span>&#92;(\hat 2 \to \sharp \hat 2 \to \hat 3 &#92;)</span>. Can have a triad, or have augmented dominant 7th.

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/04a3528ab7?outputOnly=true&start=result" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## The Diminished Dominant 4-3
Can be used in both major or minor. Start with V<sup>7</sup> chord in second inversion, and find <span>&#92;(\hat 2 &#92;)</span> in bass, then <span>&#92;(\hat 2 \to \flat \hat 2 \to \hat 1 &#92;)</span>. Best done in weak beat.

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/6c4776c680?outputOnly=true&start=result" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Example 25.26, could on strong beat. In minor, <span>&#92;(\flat \hat 3\to \flat \hat 2 \to \hat 1 &#92;)</span>.



## CTdim7 to I, I6 and C6/4
- <span>&#92;(\hat 5 \to \sharp \hat 4 \to \hat 5 &#92;)</span>
- <span>&#92;(\hat 5 \to \hat 6 \to \hat 5 &#92;)</span> or <span>&#92;(\hat 3 \to \hat 6 \to \hat 5 &#92;)</span> or <span>&#92;(\hat 1\to \hat 6\to \hat 5 &#92;)</span>
- <span>&#92;(\hat 3\to \hat \sharp \hat 2\to \hat 3 &#92;)</span>
- <span>&#92;(\hat 1 \to \hat 1&#92;)</span> (common tone)

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/16971e938e?outputOnly=true&start=result" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Ex 25.30: could use CT before <span>&#92;(C_4^6 &#92;)</span>

Ex 25.31: pre-cadential dominant <span>&#92;(\to &#92;)</span> CT <span>&#92;(\to &#92;)</span> C6/4

## The extended Authentic Cadence
Authentic Cadence ends on <span>&#92;(\hat 3 &#92;)</span> in romantic century. <span>&#92;(\hat 4\to \hat 3 &#92;)</span> or <span>&#92;(\hat 2\to \hat 3 &#92;)</span> in soprano.

## The plagal 6-5
Plagal cadence: Soprano <span>&#92;(\hat 1 \to \hat 4\to \hat 3 &#92;)</span>

IV I cadence. Ex 25.12: 4-1 close in the bass, 1-2-3 passing motion on soprano. 1 is elided, 2 moves back to occupy the strong beat, and 3 is raised to create the Picardy third characteristic  of this cadence.
Resulting chord is called **plagal <span>&#92;(^6_5 &#92;)</span>**.

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/2c82bb8b85?outputOnly=true&start=result" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## The plagal 4-3
Wanna introduce 878. diminished in minor (example below), half diminished in major.

# §26: Formal Modulation
This is the week after reading week. It serves as a break thus it's a lighter week.

A local tonic can be confirmed briefly within the phrase within the phrase as a momentary inflection or prolonged as a more emphatic event - the process of *tonicization*. A local tonic can also be established at the phrase cadence or prolonged into the cadence, where it offers a more serious challenge to the primary tonic - the process of *phrase modulation*. Or, a local tonic can be extended in duration to govern an entire section of the music, creating a secondary tonal region that presents a significant opposition to the primary key: this process is called **formal modulation**.
## T3B-07
First one: start in f# minor, ends in relative major. Second one: F major, ends in V.

# §27: The Chromatic Sequence
Like its diatonic model, a chromatic model can serve as a transitional passage between two chords within the same tonal area.


Other possibilities are not presented here because I am not going to use them...

4 chromatic options for Deceptive Resolution Chromatic Sequence
- Interpolated Applied Dominants
- Harmonic Elision
- PM minor: Phrygian II Major
- Aug 6th

Some refreshers: [Deceptive Resolutions of Secondary Dominants](http://www.jkornfeld.net/Deceptive_secondary_resolutions.pdf)

## Composing a Chromatic Sequence
1. Choosing a sequence and setting-up the framework
2. Completing the first measure that resolves well into measure 2
3. completing the sequence to the cadence (completing measures 2 and 3)
4. Completing the sequence (the cadence, figured bass and analysis)

# §28: Secondary Mixture
In chapter 23, we met the process of primary mixture: combine a key's major and minor modes in shared harmonic relationships. Here we meet a second means of key enhancement. Melodic chromaticism again informs the process; but where a chromatic pitch in primary mixture serves to introduce a chord belonging to the music's parallel mode, here a chromatic pitch acts to convert the quality of a chord belonging to the music's prevailing mode. Can be elaborative chord, be tonicized, or formal modulation. This process is called **secondary mixture**.

|| Primary Mixture | Secondary Mixture     |
|:-| :------------- | :------------- |
|Major | <span>&#92;(\flat \hat 6 &#92;)</span>: II, IV <br> <span>&#92;(\flat \hat 3 &#92;)</span>: I<br> <span>&#92;(\flat \hat 6, \flat \hat 3 &#92;)</span>: VI<br> (borrowed from minor)  | <span>&#92;(\sharp \hat 5 &#92;): iii becomes III</span> <br> <span>&#92;(\sharp \hat 1 &#92;)</span>: vi becomes VI     |
|minor| <span>&#92;(\flat \hat 2 &#92;)</span>: II Phrygian or N<sup>6</sup><br> <span>&#92;(\sharp \hat 3 &#92;)</span>: I <br> <span>&#92;(\sharp \hat 6 &#92;)</span>: IV, II <br> <span>&#92;(\sharp \hat 6, \sharp \hat 3 &#92;)</span>: VI | <span>&#92;(\flat \hat 4 &#92;)</span>: bII becomes bii <br> <span>&#92;(\flat \hat 1 &#92;)</span>: VI becomes vi |

## Secondary Mixture in Major
Raising <span>&#92;(\hat 5 &#92;)</span> in a major key will alter the chordal third of III, converting the chord's quality from minor to major.

Example 28.4: When VI follows major III.

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/0c41ab7561" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Ex 28.7: When major VI is prolonged, then it must be tonicized to the prolongation. Secondary mixture is a bit jarring than PM because it doesn't borrow from another mode.

Ex 28.9: When II follows major VI. We need to make sure voice leading works: <span>&#92;(\sharp \hat 1\to \hat 2 &#92;)</span>
## Secondary Mixture in Minor

Ex 28.10 (a): Not a prolongation. It's minor VI which embellishes I.

Ex 28.10 (b): Subdominant prolongation, minor mode IV<sup>6</sup>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/851f186043" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Ex 28.11: Enharmonic resolution, going from elaborative SM to dominant: <span>&#92;(\flat \hat 1 \to (\sharp)\hat 7 &#92;)</span>

Ex 28.12: The minor Neapolitan 6.

##  The Stable Six-four chord
Chapter 12: Passing 64, Cadential 64. Chapter 22: Neighbor, Pedal, Arp 64. [Some refreshers](http://www.musictheoryteacher.com/pb/wp_94176fc5/wp_94176fc5.html)

The applied dominant that introduces this chord confirms the chordal fourth as a local tonic, permitting the stable <span>&#92;(^6_4 &#92;)</span> to function harmonically as a consonant chord. In a major key, the stable <span>&#92;(^6_4 &#92;)</span> will occasionally sound as a modally borrowed subdominant.

Ex 28.20 (score from [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/37922)): mm. 2 is Nbr <span>&#92;(^6_4 &#92;)</span>, mm. 6 is Stable <span>&#92;(^6_4 &#92;)</span>

## The Cadential Pedal Extension
A pedal extension allows the music's momentum to carry past the authentic cadence into elaborations of the cadential tonic.

# §29: The Romance
> The Romance resembles the Notturno. We invent a two-part theme, with each part repeated. This is immediately succeeded by a new theme as a middle subject, of the same description as the former, but in another key, each part of which may also be repeated. A return is then made to the first theme, without repetition, or else embellished, at pleasure. A more or less developed conclusion completes the whole.

By Carl Czerny

Cantilena: "song melody", used in instrumental music.

History of the instrumental romance:
- ca.1200 - ca.1400: Medieval Period in Spain (romance) in Italy (romanza)
- ca.1400 - ca.1600's:  Renaissance in Spain and Italy
- ca.1600 - ca.1800: Baroque & Classical + in France, Germany & Italy

## Formal Design

| A                          | B                                     | A'                   |   
|:----------------------------|:---------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| Period 1, P1, P2, P2 | \|\|: Period 1 :\|\|: Period 2 :\|\|  | Period 1', Period 2' |
| Major Key | Parallel Minor Key or related key | (reprise) Major key |
| *andante* or *adagio* | *agitato* | *andante* or *adagio* |
| theme called: **cantilena** | Melodic line. Rests. RESTLESS theme | cantilena theme is elaborated. |

*Intro* before A, *retransition* between B and A'. After A', *coda*.

## A section
Period 1
- Introduction in accompanying voices, then ONE voice presents first period of the cantilena
- first period then repeats.
- cadence of the first period will be an internal cadence. NOT PAC in primary tonic.

Period 2
- One voice presents the second period of cantilena.
- The second period then repeats.
- The cadence of the second period will be PAC in the primary tonic.

## B section
- An agitato character to contrast the lyricism of the cantilena
- The melodic line can spin out in a dense figuration articulated in compressed rhythmic patterns
- The melodic line can also fragment into short, leaping motives punctuated by rests.
- Rests can also interrupt melodic figures or displace their strong-beat entries, to accentuate the  characteristic restlessness of the agitato theme.
- Tone repetition can be introduced in single statement or reiterated motivically, to emphasise the line’s essential urgency.
- Short appoggiaturas and rhythmically displaced passing and neighbouring tones can be introduced to good effect here (keep the broader suspension and retardation figures in the cantilena melody in the A section)  
- parallel minor or related key
- 2 periods, repeated sign
- change of meter/tempo
-  accompanying voices reinforce the agitato nature of this section

## The retransition
- The retransition acts as a connective link leading from the B section to a
varied reprise of the A section
- The retransition is four to six measures long and begins anywhere and
ends on <span>&#92;( \hat 2,\hat 4 &#92;)</span> or <span>&#92;( \hat 7 &#92;)</span> to accommodate the dominant.

## The CODA
- The romance closes in a coda, the counterpart to the introduction (but
the coda is much longer!)
- The coda is four to six measures long and is a cadential pedal
extension.
- The tonic chord will occupy the first and final measures and the bass
will sound <span>&#92;( \hat 1 &#92;)</span> through the coda

## The reprise
- The reprise typically features an elaboration of the primary theme (the cantilena)
- The accompanying voices can recall figuration from the B section as a means of unifying the structure
- The reprise proceeds without repeats
