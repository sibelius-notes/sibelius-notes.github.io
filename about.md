## About
This website contains Lecture Notes only, as well as my thoughts regarding the courses. To get started, either take a walk on the homepage or check the top nav bar.

Note that the lecture notes of some courses are quite incomplete because they just serve to give you a taste what the course is about.

## Disclaimer

Most of these notes are written in their entirety by me, [Sibelius Peng](https://sibeliusp.com), while attending lectures at the University of Waterloo. I have no intentions of violating any UW policies and will gladly honour takedown notices produced by an authorized UW representative. They are by no means authoritative so use at your own peril.

The course thumbnails are either from learn site, which the instructor uploads for the course, or from the internet.
Cute color icons for each subject are taken from

## Miscellaneous

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOYRlicwLG3St5aEm02ncj-sPDJwmojIS" target="_blank">Map videos</a> - from Domain of Science. I saw these maps frequently on a TV by the door of main reception desk (DC 2326).
